# Bargain Bazaar

Welcome to the Bargain Bazaar project repository. This project was designed and developed by Team Innov8ors, with the goal of providing a platform for college seniors to sell their old or used items to juniors. It's essentially a marketplace for second-hand items that facilitates a sustainable and economical way for college students to acquire what they need. The project employs a full stack development approach, using Flask and SQLite on the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend.

## Setting Up and Running the Project

1. Set up a Python virtual environment. This helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. You can install `virtualenv` using pip.
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
2. Create a new virtual environment.
    ```
    virtualenv bazaar_env
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment.
    - On Windows:
        ```
        .\\bazaar_env\\Scripts\\activate
        ```
    - On Unix or MacOS:
        ```
        source bazaar_env/bin/activate
        ```
4. Install the required Python packages using pip.
    ```
    pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_login werkzeug flask_wtf
    ```
5. Run the Flask application.
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
6. Open the frontend HTML pages in your preferred web browser.
